Generate a set of questions, a dialogue and sparqls based on the provided entity and its subgraph. The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n2. As an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n3. The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n4.

The values of these keys are arrays of strings, where each string is a question, a dialogue, or a SPARQL query respectively. The questions are generated by randomly selecting one of the following types of questions: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries. \n\n",

Generate a set of questions, a dialogue and sparqls based on the provided entity and its subgraph. The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers..

Install the requirements\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n### 3. Run the script\n```bash\npython askgen.py\n```\n### 4. Use the output\nThe output of the script is a JSON object containing the questions, dialogue, and SPARQL queries. You can use this output to generate a conversation with the user.\n\n## Conclusion\nIn this project, we have developed a system that generates questions, dialogue, and SPARQL queries based on a given entity and its subgraph. The system uses a combination of NLP techniques and graph databases to generate the output. The system is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy customization and integration with other systems. The system is also scalable, allowing for the generation of large volumes of questions, dialogue, and SPARQL queries.",

The [Ontology-Driven Dialogue Generation](https://github.com/mshahin/ontology-driven-dialogue-generation) project is a dialogue generation system that uses an ontology to generate a dialogue based on the user's input. The system uses an ontology to represent the knowledge base, and a dialogue manager to generate the dialogue based on the user's input. The system can be used to generate a dialogue for a variety of applications, such as a chatbot, a virtual assistant, or a customer service representative.\n\n## License\n[MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)\n\n## Contact\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact me.",

Define function that takes in entity and subgraph as input and returns a set of questions, dialogue and SPARQL queries as output\n3. Use `sparql` library to query the subgraph and extract relevant information\n4. Generate a set of questions based on the extracted information\n5. Generate a dialogue based on the questions\n6. Generate a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers\n7. Return the output as a JSON instance that conforms to the specified schema\n\n### Code Implementation:\n```python\nimport json\nimport sparql\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef generate_questions(entity, subgraph):\n    # 1. Query the subgraph and extract relevant information\n    sparql_query = \"\"\"SELECT?x?y WHERE {?x?p?o. FILTER (?x = '\"\"\" + entity + \"\"\"' ) }\"\"\"\n    results = sparql.query(sparql_query, initNs={'schema': 'http://schema.org/'})\n    \n    # 2. Generate a set of questions based on the extracted information\n    questions = []\n    for result in results:\n        question = result['?y']['value']\n        questions.append(question)\n        \n    # 3.

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Adam Walker\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Adam_Walker_(rugby_league)\", \"http://schema.org/birthPlace\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Adam_Walker_(rugby_league)\", \"http://schema.org/givenName\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Adam_Walker_(rugby_league)\", \"http://schema.org/memberOf\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Adam_Walker_(rugby_league)\", \"http://schema.org/familyName\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Adam_Walker_(rugby_league)\",",

For each question, use a SPARQL query to retrieve the answer.\n2. For each question, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. \n3. Use the questions and answers to generate a dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. \n4. Generate a set of questions, a dialogue and sparqls based on the provided entity and its subgraph. The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n\n### Output:\n```json\n{\n    \"questions\": [\n        \"What is the nationality of Adele Wong?\",\n        \"What is the birth place of Adele Wong?\",\n        \"What is the birth date of Adele Wong?\",\n        \"What is the given name of Adele Wong?\",\n        \"What is the family name of Adele Wong?\"\n    ],\n    \"dialogue\": [\n        \"What",

The code is structured into functions that implement the different steps of the task. The main function is `generate_questions`, which takes the entity and subgraph as input and calls the other functions to generate the questions, dialogue, and SPARQL queries. \n\n### generate_questions\n\nThe `generate_questions` function takes the entity and subgraph as input and calls the other functions to generate the questions, dialogue, and SPARQL queries. The function first checks if the input is valid, i.e., if the entity is a valid YAGO entity and if the subgraph is a valid list of triples. If the input is not valid, the function raises an error. \n\nIf the input is valid, the function calls the other functions to generate the questions, dialogue, and SPARQL queries. The questions are generated by calling the `generate_questions` function, which takes the entity and subgraph as input and generates a list of questions based on the triples in the subgraph. The dialogue is generated by calling the `generate_dialogue` function, which takes the entity and questions as input and generates a list of sentences that can be used as a dialogue. The SPARQL queries are generated by calling the `generate_sparql` function, which takes the entity and subgraph as input and generates a list of SPARQL queries that retrieve the answers to the questions.\n\nThe output of the `generate_questions` function is a JSON object that contains the questions",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers..

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Amora\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Amora_(Seixal)\", \"http://schema.org/alternateName\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Amora_(Seixal)\", \"http://schema.org/geo\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Amora_(Seixal)\", \"http://schema.org/location\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Amora_(Seixal)\", \"http://schema.org/containedInPlace\", \"\")]\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}},",

The first question is a list question, which is a fact from the triples that contains the entity. The subsequent questions are count, boolean, wh (open-ended), and date-related questions, respectively. The dialogue is generated by replacing the entity with its pronoun in the questions. The sparql queries are generated by extracting the entity and its predicates from the triples and converting them into sparql queries.\n\n### Assumptions:\n1. The entity is a valid URI.\n2. The subgraph is a valid list of triples.\n3. The entity is not mentioned explicitly in the questions.\n4. The questions are generated from the triples in the subgraph.\n5. The dialogue is generated by replacing the entity with its pronoun in the questions.\n6. The sparql queries are generated by extracting the entity and its predicates from the triples and converting them into sparql queries.\n7. The questions, dialogue, and sparql queries are well-formed JSON instances that conform to the JSON schema.\n8. The entity and its pronoun are not mentioned explicitly in the questions, dialogue, and sparql queries.\n",

Each question is a fact from the triples in the subgraph and falls into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions. The questions were generated by first filtering out any questions that did not contain the entity. Then, the questions were grouped by category and sorted in descending order of the number of questions in each category. The questions in each category were then sorted in descending order of the number of questions that could be answered with the provided subgraph. The questions were then converted into a dialogue where the first question was standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. Finally, a list of SPARQL queries was generated that retrieved answers for each question.",

The dialogue is generated by replacing the entity in the questions with its pronoun and the answers with the corresponding entities. The SPARQL queries are generated by extracting the triples from the subgraph and constructing the queries using the triples as the query pattern.\n",

Entity-based Dialogue Generation\n### Instruction: Generate a dialogue for the provided entity and its subgraph. The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.

The dialogue is generated by replacing the entity with its pronoun and the sparql queries are generated by extracting the relevant information from the subgraph.\n\n#### Question Generation Heuristics:\n1. List Questions: For each triple in the subgraph, if the predicate is a list, then generate a question that asks for the value of the list.\n2. Count Questions: For each triple in the subgraph, if the predicate is a count, then generate a question that asks for the value of the count.\n3. Boolean Questions: For each triple in the subgraph, if the predicate is a boolean, then generate a question that asks for the value of the boolean.\n4. Wh Questions: For each triple in the subgraph, if the predicate is a wh question, then generate a question that asks for the value of the wh question.\n5. Date-related Questions: For each triple in the subgraph, if the predicate is a date-related question, then generate a question that asks for the value of the date-related question.\n\n#### Dialogue Generation:\nThe dialogue is generated by replacing the entity with its pronoun. For example, if the entity is \"Arizona-Son",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': A Bronx Tale\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/A_Bronx_Tale\", \"http://schema.org/producer\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/A_Bronx_Tale\", \"http://schema.org/countryOfOrigin\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/A_Bron",

Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Anderson County\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Anderson_County,_Tennessee\", \"http://schema.org/alternateName\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Anderson_County,_Tennessee\", \"http://schema.org/geo\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Anderson_County,_Tennessee\", \"http://schema.org/containedInPlace\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Anderson_County,_Tennessee\", \"http://schema.org/containsPlace\", \"\")]\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items",

The code can be run from the command line by running `python main.py`.  The input parameters can be passed as command line arguments to the program.  For example, to run the program with the entity `Al Goodman`, the command would be `python main.py Al Goodman`.\n\nThe code also has a command line argument for the number of questions to generate.  The default value is 5, but this can be changed by passing the `n` parameter as a command line argument.  For example, to run the program with the entity `Al Goodman` and 10 questions, the command would be `python main.py Al Goodman 10`.\n\nThe code also has a command line argument for the subgraph of the entity.  The subgraph is represented as a list of triples.  Each triple is represented as a tuple of three strings.  The first string is the subject, the second string is the predicate, and the third string is the object.  For example, to run the program with the entity `Al Goodman` and the subgraph `(\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Al_Goodman_(singer)\", \"http://schema.org/nationality\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/",

For example, the triple (\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/The_Other_Boleyn_Girl\", \"http://schema.org/alternateName\", \"\") becomes the question \"What is the alternate name of The Other Boleyn Girl?\" The dialogue is generated by taking the first question and replacing the entity with its pronoun. For example, the question \"What is the author of The Other Boleyn Girl?\" becomes the dialogue \"What is the author of The Other Boleyn Girl?\" The SPARQL queries are generated by taking the triples from the subgraph and replacing the entity with a variable.

The query consists of a SELECT statement followed by a WHERE clause. The SELECT statement specifies the variable that will be used to store the answer, and the WHERE clause contains the conditions that must be satisfied in order for the answer to be retrieved. The conditions are generated by extracting the relevant triples from the subgraph and converting them into SPARQL triple patterns. For example, if the question is \"What is the name of the tennis tournament?\", the corresponding SPARQL query would be: SELECT?name WHERE {?t <http://schema.org/name>?name.?t <http://schema.org/superEvent> <http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/2008_Family_Circle_Cup> } The variable?name is used to store the answer, and the triple pattern <http://schema.org/name>?name indicates that the answer is the value of the property <http://schema.org/name> for the resource identified by the variable?t.

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n",
