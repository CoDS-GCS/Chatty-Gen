The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun.

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Yitzchak Meir Teitelbaum\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Yitzchak_Meir_Teitelbaum\", \"http://schema.",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Abraham Ulrikab\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Abraham_U",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n\n'entity': Abraham Zelmanowitz\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Abraham_Zelmanowitz\", \"http://schema.org/birthPlace\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-knowledge.org",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers..

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Al-Qalamoun\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Al-Qalamoun\", \"http://schema.org/alternate",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Adam Chapman\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Adam_Chapman\", \"http://schema.org/birthPlace\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Adam_Chapman\", \"http",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Adam Devlin\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Adam_Devlin\", \"http://schema.org/birthPlace\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-know",

The subgraph is represented as a list of triples, where each triple consists of an entity, a predicate, and an object. The code uses a dictionary to store the questions, dialogue, and SPARQL queries.\n\nThe code first generates a list of questions based on the triples in the subgraph. Each question is a fact from the triples and falls into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions. Each question should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it.\n\nNext, the code generates a corresponding dialogue where the first question is standalone and subsequent questions have the entity replaced with its pronoun. The dialogue is also stored in the dictionary.\n\nFinally, the code generates a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers for each question. The queries are stored in the dictionary as well.\n\nThe code then returns the dictionary containing the questions, dialogue, and SPARQL queries. The output is formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the provided JSON schema.\n\nHere is an example of how the code works:\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport sparqlwrapper\n\ndef generate_questions(entity, subgraph):\n    questions = []\n    dialogue = []\n    sparql =",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Brooklyn Bridge\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Brooklyn_Bridge",

The subgraph consists of five triples, each representing a property of the entity. The task is to generate five questions that can be answered by the information in the subgraph.\n\nThe generated questions are as follows:\n\n1. Which language was Ben-Hur written in?\n2. What is the genre of Ben-Hur?\n3. Who wrote Ben-Hur?\n4. What play is Ben-Hur based on?\n5. What is the name of the author of Ben-Hur?\n\nEach question is generated based on the information in the subgraph. For example, the first question asks about the language used to write Ben-Hur, which is represented by the triple \"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Ben-Hur_(play)\", \"http://schema.org/inLanguage\", \"\". The second question asks about the genre of Ben-Hur, which is represented by the triple \"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Ben-Hur_(play)\", \"http://schema.org/genre\", \"\".\n\nThe generated dialogue is a set of questions that can be asked in a conversational manner. Each question in the dialogue is a standalone question, and subsequent questions have the entity replaced with its pronoun.\n\nThe generated SPARQL queries are used to retrieve the answers to the generated questions. The first query retrieves the language used to write Ben-Hur, the",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Adam Selzer\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Adam_Selzer\", \"http://schema.org/birthPlace\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-knowledge.",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Ambassador Theater\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Ambassador_Theatre_(New_York_City)\", \"http://",

We have a list of triples that represent the subgraph of the entity \"Adrian Johnson\".\n2. The triples provide information about the entity's nationality, birth date, birth place, given name, and family name.\n3. To generate questions, we need to identify the entity and the triples that represent it.\n4. We use the entity name to generate questions about its nationality, birth date, birth place, given name, and family name.\n5. The generated questions should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.\n6. Each question should be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning the entity.\n7. For the generated questions, we generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun.\n8. We also generate a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers for each question.\n9. The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema provided.",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun.

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Ahn Chang-ho\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Ahn_Changho\", \"http://schema.org/birthPlace\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-knowledge",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun.

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': John F. Kennedy\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"http://yago-knowledge.org",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Akshayraj Kore\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Akshayraj_Kore\", \"http://schema",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers..

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n\nIn this example, the entity is Al Evans, and the number of questions to generate is 5. The subgraph consists of 8 triples, each representing a fact about Al Evans.\n\nThe program generates the following questions:\n\n1. What is the birthplace of Al Evans?\n2. What is the nationality of Al Evans?\n3.",

The function first generates a set of questions based on the provided entity and its subgraph.\n2. Then it generates a dialogue by replacing the entity with its pronoun in the questions.\n3. Finally, it generates a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers for the questions.\n4. The output is formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema provided.\n\n### Additional information:\n\n1. The function uses the \"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Al_Ewing\" entity and its subgraph represented as a varied list of triples to generate the questions, dialogue, and SPARQL queries.\n2. The questions are generated based on the provided subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.\n3. The dialogue is generated by replacing the entity with its pronoun in the questions.\n4. The SPARQL queries are generated to retrieve answers for the questions.\n5.

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun.
