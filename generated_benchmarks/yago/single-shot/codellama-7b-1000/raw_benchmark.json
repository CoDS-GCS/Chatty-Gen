Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun.

Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun.

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': \n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Aktobe_Region\", \"http://schema.org/alternateName\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Aktobe_Region\", \"http://schema.org/geo\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Aktobe_",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Ada Kouri Barreto\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Ada_Kouri_Barreto\", \"http://schema.org/birthPlace\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Ada_Kouri",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Adalet Shukurov\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Adalet_Shukurov\",",

Generate a set of questions, a dialogue and sparqls based on the provided entity and its subgraph. The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Adam Bruce\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Adam_Bruce\", \"http://schema.org/nationality\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-knowledge.org/",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers..

Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun.
