The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n\n'entity': Abhishek Kapoor\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Abhishek_Kapoor\", \"http://schema.org/homeLocation\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Abhishek_Kapoor\", \"http://schema.org/nationality\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Abhishek_Kapoor\", \"http://schema.org/givenName\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Abhishek_Kapoor\", \"http://schema.org/hasOccupation\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Abhishek_Kapoor\", \"http://schema.org/spouse\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-knowledge.org",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Alhambra\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Alhambra_(film)\", \"http://schema.org/director\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Alhambra_(film)\", \"http://schema.org/productionYear\", \"1962\"), (\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Alhambra_(film)\", \"http://schema.org/writer\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Alhambra_(film)\", \"http://schema.org/cinematography\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Alhambra_(film)\", \"http://schema.org/editing\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Alhambra_(film)\", \"http://schema.org/starring\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Alhambra_(film)\", \"http://schema.org/cinematographyDirector\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Alhambra_(film)\", \"http://schema.org/cinematographyDirector\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Al",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers..

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers..

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Adam Gregory\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Adam_Gregory\", \"http://schema.org/birthPlace\",",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun.

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun.

The event was organized by the Sochi Olympic Committee and was overseen by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Sochi was selected as the host city in July 2007, after the International Olympic Committee voted to choose the Russian bid over four other bids, including one from Salzburg, Austria. Sochi was the first Russian city to host the Olympic Games, as well as the first city to ever host both the Summer Games (in 1980) and the Winter Games (in 2014), and the first city to host the Olympics three times. The Sochi Games were the first Olympics held in a Russian-speaking nation since the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. Sochi also hosted the 2011 Winter Universiade and will host the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe 2014 Games were the first Olympic Games to be held in a majority Muslim country, and the first to be held in Eastern Europe since the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. The 2014 Winter Paralympics were held immediately following the Winter Olympics, from 7 to 16 March 2014.\n\nThe 2014 Games were the first to use the emblem \"Coolest Games Ever\" and the official slogan \"Hot.

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers..

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n\n### Response:```json\n{\n  \"questions\": [\n    \"The first president of the United States was George Washington.\",\n    \"George Washington was born on February 22, 1732 in Virginia.\",\n    \"George Washington was a general.\",\n    \"George Washington was a president of the United States.\",\n    \"George Washington was a president of the United States.\"\n  ],\n  \"dialogue\": [\n    \"The first president of the United States was George Washington.\",\n    \"George Washington was born on February 22, 1",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Bern\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Bern\", \"http://schema.org/alternateName\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Al Evans\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Al_Evans\", \"http://schema.org/birthPlace\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Al_Evans\", \"http://schema.org/nationality\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Al_Evans\", \"http://schema.org/deathDate\", \"\"), (\"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun.
