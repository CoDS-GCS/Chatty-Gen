Generate a set of questions, a dialogue and sparqls based on the provided entity and its subgraph. The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Modellbasierte Energiekostenanalyse automat",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': The Great Gatsby.\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"https://dblp.org/rec/books/canon/Can1925\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#bibtexType\", \"",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Performance-guaranteed resource allocation in wireless communication systems.\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"https://dblp.org/rec/phd/dnb/Gortzen15\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#bibtexType\",",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Matthias Weidlich\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"https://dblp.org/pid/61/267\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': An Investigation of Re",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Thomas Zinner\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"https://dblp.org/pid/88/462\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#orcid\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/pid/88/462\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#primaryAffiliation\", \"\"), (\"",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun.

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers..

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Feature Map Transform Coding for Energy-Efficient CNN Inference.\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/ijcnn/ChmielBZBYKBM20\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#bibtexType\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/ijcnn/ChmielBZBYKBM20\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/ijcnn/ChmielBZBYKBM20\", \"https://d",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers..

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity':",
