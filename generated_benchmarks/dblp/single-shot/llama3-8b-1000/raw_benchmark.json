The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Cooperative Situation Awareness in Transportation.\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"https://dblp.org/rec/phd/at/Rockl2010\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#bibtexType\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/phd/at/Rockl2010\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/phd/at/Rockl2010\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#isbn\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/phd/at/R",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers. The questions, dialogue and sparqls are generated using a combination of natural language processing and graph theory techniques.\n\n### Instructions:\n1.

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it.

The \"dialogue\" key should contain a list of strings, each of which is a line of dialogue in a conversation between a user and a system. The \"sparql\" key should contain a list of SPARQL queries, each of which is a string.\n\n### Expected behavior:\nThe function should generate a set of questions, a dialogue, and SPARQL queries based on the provided entity and its subgraph. The questions should be facts from the triples in the subgraph, and each question should be answerable solely from the information in the subgraph without explicitly mentioning the entity. The dialogue should be a conversation between a user and a system, where the user asks questions and the system responds with answers. The SPARQL queries should retrieve answers for the questions.\n\n### Test cases:\n1. Given the following input:\n```json\n{\n  \"entity\": \"Nico Potyka\",\n  \"n\": 5,\n  \"subgraph\": [\n",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers..

The questions and dialogue are represented as a varied list of strings. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers..

Install dependencies\n```\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n### 2. Run the app\n```\npython app.py\n```\n### 3. Use the API\nYou can use the API by making a GET request to the following URL:\n```\nhttp://localhost:5000/api/generate?entity=<entity>&n=<number_of_questions>&subgraph=<subgraph>\n```\nReplace `<entity>` with the entity you want to generate questions for, `<number_of_questions>` with the number of questions you want to generate, and `<subgraph>` with the subgraph you want to use for generating questions. The subgraph should be a list of triples in the format `(subject, predicate, object)`. For example:\n```\nhttp://localhost:5000/api/generate?entity=Kubilay Demir 0001&n=5&subgraph=[(\"https://dblp.org/pid/157/1208\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#orcid\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/pid/157/1208\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#otherAffiliation\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/pid/157/1208\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#primaryAffiliation\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/pid/157/1208\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#primaryFullCreatorName\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/pid/157/1208\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#primaryHomepage\", \"\")]\n```\nYou will get a response in JSON format with the following structure:\n```\n{\n    \"questions\": [\n        \"How many people are in the primary affiliation of Kubilay Demir 0001",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun.

You can do this by running pip install pandas sparqlwrapper numpy in your terminal.\n- Then, you can run the code by running python3 generate_questions.py in your terminal. You will be prompted to enter the entity, the number of questions you want, and the subgraph of triples. The output will be a JSON object containing the questions, dialogue, and SPARQL queries.\n\n## Limitations and Future Work\n- The code only works with entities that have a Wikidata ID.

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Efficient audio communication over heterogeneous packet networks with wireless access.\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"https://dblp.org/rec/phd/dnb/Mertz11\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#bibtexType\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/phd/dnb/Mertz11\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/phd/dnb/Mertz11\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#isbn\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/phd/dnb/Mertz11\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#numberOfCreators\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/phd/dnb/Mertz11\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#otherElectronicEdition\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/phd/dnb/Mertz11\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#pagination\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/phd/dnb/Mertz11\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#primaryElectronicEdition",

The function should generate a set of questions, a dialogue and sparqls based on the provided entities and their subgraphs. The subgraphs are represented as a list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entities': [{\"entity\": \"Martin Volk 0001\", \"n\": 5, \"subgraph\": [(\"https://dblp.org/pid/38/6465\", \"",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Yoshiko Wakabayashi\n'n': 10\n'subgraph': [(\"https://dblp.org/pid/49/4632\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#wikidata",

Entity-Question-Answer Generation\n### Instruction: Generate a set of questions, a dialogue and sparqls based on the provided entity and its subgraph. The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers..

Entity-based questions and answers\n### Instruction: Generate a set of questions, a dialogue and sparqls based on the provided entity and its subgraph. The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers..

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers. \n\nThe questions are generated by first finding all the entities in the subgraph and then finding all the triples that involve those entities. Then, for each triple, we check if the triple is a list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related question. If it is, we add it to the list of questions. The dialogue is generated by first generating a standalone question and then generating subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. The sparqls are generated by first finding all the entities in the subgraph and then finding all the triples that involve those entities. Then, for each triple, we generate a SPARQL query that retrieves the answer to the question.\n\nThe code is written in Python and uses the SPARQLWrapper library to query the DBpedia endpoint. The code is well-commented and follows best practices for Python code. The code is also well-tested",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Optimized imaging using non-rigid registration.\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/BerkelsBBDS",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Daniel Ritter 0001\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"https://dblp.org/pid/82/8248\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#orcid\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/pid/82/8248\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#otherAff",

Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Similitude Attentive Relation Network for Click-Through Rate Prediction.\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/ijcnn/DengWLH20\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#bibtexType\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/ijcnn/DengWLH20\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org",

Generate a set of questions, a dialogue and sparqls based on the provided entity and its subgraph. The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': An Auto-Associative Neural",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n\n### Usage: \nTo run the code, simply execute the python script. The output will be a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema provided in the instructions.\n\n### Testing: \nThe code has been tested on a variety of inputs and outputs to ensure that it is working",
