The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': The Witcher\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"https://dblp.org/rec/bibtex/book/sza10\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#bibtexType\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/bibtex/book/sza10\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/bibtex/book/sza10\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#isbn\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/bibtex/book/sza10\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#numberOfCreators\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/bibtex/book/sza1",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Ben Hermann 0001\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"https://dblp.org/",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Design patterns and frameworks for developing WIMP+ user interfaces.\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"https://dblp.org/rec/phd/dnb/Wu01\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#bibtexType\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/phd/dnb/Wu01\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers..

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Be sparse! Be dense!

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': A supervised CAD to support telemedicine in hematology.\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"https://dblp.org/rec/conf",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun.

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Evolving recurrent neural networks are super-Turing.\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it.

The subgraph is then filtered to remove the entity itself and all the triples that are not in the \nlist of relations we want to consider. This list of relations is defined in the file `config/question_generation/relation_blacklist.txt`. \n\nNext, the subgraph is converted to a graph representation using `networkx`. We then extract the connected components of the graph. We then extract the triples from each connected component \nand filter out the ones that do not contain any of the entities in the component. We then extract the relations from",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Christian Meilicke\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"https://dblp.org/pid/76/3199\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#wikid",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Dblp\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/ijcnn/DouW15\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#bibtexType\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/ijcnn",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Gerhard Rigoll\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"https://dblp.org/pid/78/2835\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#orcid\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/pid/78/2835\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#primaryAffiliation\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/pid/",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Neurodynamics and the mind.\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/ijcnn/Duch11\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#bibtexType\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/ijcnn/Duch",
