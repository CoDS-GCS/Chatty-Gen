The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals.\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"https://dblp.org/rec/phd/Turing38\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#bibtexType\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/phd/Turing38\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/phd/Turing38\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#doi\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/phd/Turing38\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#numberOfCreators\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/phd/Turing38\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#otherElectronicEdition\", \"\"), (\"https://",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers..

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Generalized Sampling and Infinite-Dimensional Compressed Sensing.\n'n': 6\n'subgraph': [(\"https://dblp.org/rec/journals/focm/AdcockH16\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#bibtexType\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/journals/focm/AdcockH16\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/journals/focm/AdcockH16\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#doi\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/journals/focm/AdcockH16\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#numberOfCreators\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/journals/focm/AdcockH16\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#pagination\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/journals/focm/AdcockH16\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#primaryElectronicEdition\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/journals/focm/AdcockH16\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#yearOfPublication\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/journals/focm/AdcockH16\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#publishedInJournal\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/journals/focm/AdcockH16",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun.

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Diaz-Banez, S. (2005). Covering point sets with two convex objects.

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n\n'entity': Efficient and Accurate Text Detection for the Wildlife Photo Dataset.\n'n': 3\n'subgraph': [(\"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/ijcnn/Aida00\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#bibtexType\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/ijcnn/Aida00\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/ijcnn/Aida00\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#doi\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/ijcnn/Aida00\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#numberOfCreators\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/ijcnn/Aida00\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#otherElectronicEdition\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/ijcnn/Aida00\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#pagination\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/ijcnn/Aida00\", \"https://dblp.org",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers..

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Francesco Kriegel\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"https://dblp.org/pid/163/5141\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#orcid\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/pid/163/5141\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#primaryAffiliation\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/pid/163/5141\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#primaryFullCreatorName\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/pid/163/5141\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#primaryHomepage\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/pid/163/5141\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#webpage\", \"\")]\n\n### Response:```json\n{\"questions\": [\"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#orcid\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#primaryAffiliation\",",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': John F.

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': \n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/ijcnn/AnguitaGOR11\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#bibtexType\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/ijcnn/AnguitaGOR11\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/ijcnn/AnguitaGOR11\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#doi\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/ijcnn/AnguitaGOR11\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#numberOfCreators\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/ij",

The set of triple patterns should be a varied list of triple patterns. Each question should be a fact from the graph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided graph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n\n'entity': Computing the Interleaving Distance is NP-Hard.\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"https://dblp.org/rec/journals/focm/BjerkevikBK20\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#bibtexType\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/journals/focm/BjerkevikBK20\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/journals/focm/BjerkevikBK20\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#doi\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/journals/focm/BjerkevikBK20\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#numberOfCreators\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/journals/focm/BjerkevikBK20\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#pagination\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/journals/focm/BjerkevikBK20\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#primaryElectronicEdition\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp",

The seminar was sponsored by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the German National Academic Foundation (Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes). The main goal of the seminar was to bring together researchers working on different aspects of graph drawing. The seminar had two main themes: (1) algorithmic aspects of graph drawing and (2) applications of graph drawing. The first theme covered a variety of topics, including algorithms for computing good layouts, algorithms for computing good layouts with respect to user-specified criteria, and algorithms for computing good layouts with respect to user-specified criteria. The second theme covered a variety of topics, including applications of graph drawing in computer graphics, in human-computer interaction, and in data visualization.

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it.

Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun.

Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions. Each question should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n\n'entity':\n[(\"https://dblp.org/rec/journals/focm/CandesR07\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#bibtexType\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/journals/focm/CandesR07\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/journals/focm/CandesR07\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#doi\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/journals/focm/CandesR07\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#numberOfCreators\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/journals/focm/CandesR07\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#pagination\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/journals/focm/CandesR07\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#primaryElectronicEdition\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/journals/focm/CandesR07\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#yearOfPublication\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/journals/focm/CandesR0",

Each triple should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun.

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers..

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun.

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers..

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n\n'entity': Frank Schulz 0002\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"https://dblp.org/pid/s/FranKSchulz2\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#wikidata\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/pid/s/FranKSchulz2\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#orcid\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/pid/s/FranKSchulz2\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#primaryAffiliation\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': AI-Driven Recommendation of Cognitive Therapy Treatments for Mental Health.\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/SabharwalKM16\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#bibtexType\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/SabharwalKM16\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/SabharwalKM16\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#doi\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/SabharwalKM16\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#numberOfCreators\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/SabharwalKM16\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#pagination\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/journals",
