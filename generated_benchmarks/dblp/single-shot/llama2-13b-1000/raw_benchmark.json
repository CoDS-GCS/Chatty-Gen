The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it.

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n\n'entity': Katie Shilton\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"https://dblp.org/pid/154/0113\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Toward a cooperative brain: Continuing the work with John Taylor.\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/ijcnn/Apolloni13\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#bibtexType\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/ijcnn/Apolloni13\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/ijcnn/Apolloni13\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#doi\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/ijcnn/Apolloni13\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#numberOfCreators\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/ijcnn/Apolloni13\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#pagination\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/ijcnn/Apolloni13\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#primaryElectronicEdition\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/ijcnn/Apolloni13\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#yearOfPublication\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/ijcnn/Apolloni13\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#publishedIn\", \"\"), (\"https://dbl",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n\n'entity': Scalable and Sustainable Mobile Data Analytics for Smarter Cities.\n'n': 5\n'subgraph':",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': MIMO SVMs for 3D object classification.\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/ijcnn/Arana-DanielB06\", \"https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#bibtexType\", \"\"), (\"https://dblp.org/rec/conf/ijcnn/Aran",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Fabian Fischer 0001\n'n': 5\n'subgraph': [(\"https://dblp.org/pid/82/",

The dialogue is generated by using the first question as the first sentence and the subsequent questions are generated by replacing the entity with its pronoun. The SPARQL query is generated by using the question as the WHERE clause.\n\n### Hint:\n\nThis is a very basic question generation and dialogue generation problem. It is similar to the [Question Generation](../question_generation/README.md) and [Dialogue Generation](../dialogue_generation/README.md) tasks.\n\n### Resources:\n\n- [Question Generation](../question_generation/README.md)\n- [Dialogue Generation](../dialogue_generation/README.md)\n- [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/)\n\n### References:\n\n- [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/)\n",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Robin Thomas 0001\n'n': 10\n'subgraph': [(\"https://dblp.org/pid/01/2054\", \"https",

The subgraph is represented as a varied list of triples. Each question should be a fact from the triples in the subgraph and fall into one of the following categories: list, count, boolean, wh (open-ended), or date-related questions.  Each question  should have the entity and be answerable solely from the information in the provided subgraph without explicitly mentioning it. For the generated questions, generate a corresponding dialogue where the first is standalone and subsequent questions with replaced entity with its pronoun. And a list of SPARQL queries that retrieves answers.. Return the following: questions, dialogue, and  SPARQL queries.\n'entity': Simon J.
